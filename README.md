# Movie_Recommender_System
A simple movie recommender system based on Imdb5000 dataset. We find similarity index between movies as he number of common words in the concatenation of plot + actor + director + ..  + etc and find the similarity of each movie with each of the other movies. Then, given a movie, we return 5 movies with maximum similarity index as the output.
